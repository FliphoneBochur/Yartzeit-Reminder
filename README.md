# Yartzeit-Reminder
Google Apps Script to email a reminder the day before a yartzeit.

See the pictures to see how I set up my spreadsheet and form.

Don't forget to set up a trigger to run once a day at whatever time you want to get a reminder, although keep in mind the script changes days at 12:00 a.m., not at shkiyah.
