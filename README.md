# Yartzeit-Reminder
Google Apps Script to email a reminder the day before a yartzeit.

See the Sample Spredsheet picture to see how I made my spreadsheet.

When you create your own Google sheet, make sure to paste the SpreadsheetID between the quotes on line 3.

Make sure to change the family names used on lines 146 - 155 to your own family names.

Lastly, don't forget to set up a trigger to run once a day at whatever time you want to get a reminder, although keep in mind the script changes days at 12:00 a.m., not at shkiyah.
